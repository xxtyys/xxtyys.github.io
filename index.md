# Chen Yujun's Homepage

I graduated with a Master's in Engineering from the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english), where I was part of the [Okumura-Funakoshi Lab](https://lr-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/). Before that, I earned my Bachelor's in Business Administration from [South China Agricultural University](https://english.scau.edu.cn/).

## Recent Updates
- [2024-04-01] I joined the Panasonic R&D in Osaka, Japan, as an Data Scientist.
- [2024-01-12] I have drafted a preliminary work on fine-tuning LLaVA for multimodal sentiment classification. This approach outperformed all previous studies, boosting accuracy by 7.31% and weighted-F1 by 8.76% on the MVSA-Single dataset. Check out [this post](/arts/llavac-minimal) for more details.
